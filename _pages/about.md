Hey!  
I am a Data Analyst/Scientist with 3+ years of experience of analysing data. I am well versed in MySQL, Python as well as Machine Learning Algorithms and Artificial Intelligence. The thing I like most about being a data scientist is that I can identify and tell the story to the world, which my data is trying to tell.  
I hail from Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India and am currently working in an MNC In Guragon, India.  
I have done my B.Tech in Computer Science from Jaypee Institute of Information Technology (JIIT), Noida, India. and passed in 2017 with honors.  
Apart from the trying to decode the mysteries in the data, I like spending my time listening to music, exploring new places, draw and paint and binge watch a lot of TV shows and movies.
