Hey!  
I am a Data Scientist with 4+ years of experience analysing data and creating models. I am well versed in MySQL, Python as well as Machine Learning Algorithms and Artificial Intelligence. The thing I like most about being a data scientist is that I can identify and narrate the story to the world, which my data is trying to tell.  
I hail from Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India and am currently working in an MNC in Noida, India.  
I have done my B.Tech in Computer Science from Jaypee Institute of Information Technology (JIIT), Noida, India and passed out in 2017 with honors.  
Apart from the trying to decode the mysteries in the data, I like spending my time listening to music, exploring new places, draw & paint and binge watch a lot of TV shows, movies and animes.
